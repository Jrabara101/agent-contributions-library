1. Doing very well
2. Um, yeah, I think I'm just generally pretty happy, happy cat
3. So always, always positive
4. So I got in 2018
5. Actually, it was kind of a, because I was horny
6. There's this girl in my college was like, yo, you know, come pull up to the blockchain club
7. I was like, no, no fucking clue what the fuck that is
8. But you know, her, her thighs were crazy
9. I just followed her to the blockchain club
10. She's like talking about stuff I have no idea about
11. She told me XRP was a scam
12. That's all she said
13. So I was like, sure, you know, I'll give you all my cash, buy me some crypto
14. So I bought like two grand of Bitcoin
15. Then in a month, it dropped from like six grand to like three grand
16. And I was like, incredible
17. Like, I don't know why, but I just bought, I kept buying
18. So that's how I got in
19. And then I realized that, you know, just holding Bitcoin is like, makes me poor because like, you know, I went to 13k, I only went from like, you know, five grand net worth to like, I don't know, like 15 grand net worth
20. And I was like, yeah, this is not working out
21. I need to like start using like a ton of leverage
22. So yeah, that kept going
23. So that was how it started
24. The cat lore is like multi-layered, multi-dimension, much deeper
25. When I was one, my mom took me to a fortune teller
26. And the fortune teller was like, wow, he's going to be a great writer, which is very true
27. My tweets are always bangers and hitting
28. But he said something else, which is really worrisome for our bloodline
29. He's going to be doing all right, pretty good
30. But there's a massive issue
31. There is evil behind him, trying to get him
32. But there is a counterattack
33. You can prevent this, right
34. And she's like, yo, of course I want to prevent it
35. And he's like, he needs a very cute nickname
36. Then he will do really well
37. And then she was like, huh, all right
38. So she started calling me Cat in Chinese
39. Yeah, yeah, one
40. So that's how it started
41. So, and then like, you know, many, many years later, and this is like, these two events are not even like related
42. I didn't even know, like, or I, like in my head, I didn't even know this background story, nor was aware, like why she was calling me a cat, whatever, bullshit
43. And then one day, a bunch of my friends were like, you know, this, this is like totally you, like you should just beat, like beat this
44. And it was like some cat profile picture
45. And I was like, yeah
46. I'm down there, you know, why not
47. So I became a cat
48. And then over time, like, you know, COVID happened, I had to put on the hazmat suit, you know, virtually, you know, virtual COVID could hit you hard
49. Yeah, so I got this hazmat suit, I chose yellow and then, you know, and then one day
50. I was like, wait, hold up, like, why am I that same identity as like what my mom's calling me
51. Is that like, I had this like insane realization like maybe two years later
52. So I asked her and then she told me the fortune teller story
53. I was like very mind blown that it like, it all bridged together
54. So I think that's a, that's a full door of the, yeah, the cat persona
55. No, I think it's very unique, like easily recognizable
56. Yellow is like an adorable color
57. I think it's very good
58. So like at this point, I don't think I'll change it
59. And it's like, if you want to like take off my like hazmat suit, maybe if you're a hot girl, potentially, but yeah, otherwise
60. The suit, yeah, yeah
61. Yeah, pretty much
62. Yeah, I think near 99% of my gains is like Bitcoin ETH, just trading Bitcoin ETH, yeah
63. Um, I mean, this is hard to explain, but like, like, there's always levels, which I, well, at least to me, it's like relatively obvious
64. I have watched people take positions, you know, like, you
65. And then you automatically in your head generate a mental liquidation profile of all these trades, right
66. So it's very simple
67. If they're on X20, it's 5% move, X25, 4%
68. X10 is very popular, so 10% moves usually never happens
69. It always runs a few percent deeper just from these liquidations
70. or just like generally stop losses being triggered at like a pretty obvious like level and then like well at least when I used to trade I try to you know like shove it a little bit more into that that way
71. so like they they get fucked a little bit harder
72. and then you know I sell into when they're getting fucked
73. A bit of everything
74. For a while, I really, really loved knowing where price is going
75. It was like this strong curiosity and like urge to
76. just want to be correct, just want to know why each moves are happening, and then predicting it, and then put a bit of money on all my views
77. And then over time, I'm not sure why, it just doesn't hit the same
78. And on top of that, there's one day, I think almost the very last day of December 2020
79. yeah, last day of the year
80. I was just like, you know
81. I had like an Ave bag, not too much
82. I had an SNX bag
83. There weren't like millions of dollars, but like, I just felt like the swing was so crazy
84. I just kept going up
85. I'm like, why am I still holding this shit
86. Like, or like, like all my trades are working and hitting like, I'm just gonna take a break for a bit, right
87. And then once I took that break, I
88. It was so mind-blowing how I didn't realize how stressed I was
89. I didn't realize it was like, you know, clouds above my head
90. Because I do it 24 seven, you know, when I sleep, I dream about it
91. I had an ex, like when I fuck, I'm actually thinking about the chart
92. There's nothing else in the universe other than like me, like trying to outplay someone on like BTC, USD, perps
93. So it was like
94. Like, I don't know, I just couldn't, like, redo that ever again, just because, like, once that stress and everything, like, lifted, I was just like, yeah, you know, I was just happy to live like this
95. Yes, this is great
96. This is what I, I guess, originally fall for, and I'm just gonna, yeah, not go as hard, yeah
97. That's also hard
98. I think it's around this
99. It's not too much harder
100. I think it's still very doable
101. I don't really trade too much anymore, but I can still
102. you know, like take a quick look and like, sometimes I have a very strong bias and my hit rate, at least mentally so far, like of mental trades I'm taking, they're hitting pretty well
103. So I don't know, I've ascended to a level, I'm just like
104. I'm mentally taking profit here
105. Like, oh, that was a great trade
106. I still got this totally
107. Like if I made this trade, I would have been right
108. So yeah, just stuff like that
109. So I definitely think yeah
110. it's like the ETF coming in
111. It's not like completely a meme, at least in the moment, right
112. That's like, the flows are so strong
113. You can like just trend follow
114. I don't know
115. There's so much bullshit you can do still
116. A lot of it still trades similarly to 2019, 2020
117. Maybe it was less percentages
118. We hit a bunch of traders' margin levels and then maybe we do 3% instead of 20%
119. We used to bark non-stop
120. So it definitely matured in that sense
121. 3% is still so huge, at least to me
122. Yeah, I'm extremely proud of the July-August move in summer 2020, because I think I'm the only one on Twitter who's calling
123. Like we're going to send so hard that Binance is going to break
124. And it literally broke
125. It was the biggest candle
126. I tweeted how it was like, I give it like one third chance
127. We're going to print the biggest like move in Bitcoin history
128. And we, I think it was a move from like 28 to like 40K on Binance futures in like two minutes or something, something crazy like that
129. So I'm very validated by that
130. Like just, that just means like I was correct about the markets positioning and then like
131. where the liquidation levels were and people just getting cascaded into empty books
132. So many of them, in fact, that Binance goes down, like these being correct
133. And then I also said how market will never short Bitcoin this hard ever again, which we haven't seen so far
134. Yeah, so like that's like one thing I'm pretty proud of, I guess, but not really too many memorable trades
135. I actually fucked up that trade super hard just because I was holding the position for a month
136. And it was just ranging and doing nothing
137. But I still managed to catch a decent move
138. If you're up here, I'm happy
139. So yeah, like, yeah
140. Yeah, basically what you said is, I think, amazing
141. Like just absolutely ascended mentally, like nothing is going to, like you're never tilted, obviously, and you're not going to revenge trade, obviously, like
142. At least that that to me is like very barbaric behavior like if you can't like even Mentally control you like you're like discipline like your mental state if you can't control these I Think it's pretty that's pretty barbaric, right
143. Like I don't know if that's like insulting but like that's just how I view it
144. I I don't think I've ever had too much problem with discipline, but that's definitely improved a lot as I traded over time
145. Yeah, I think mental is definitely the most important
146. Because if you can think clearly, then you're going to have good risk management
147. You're going to think how much you're going to put on, where you're going to cut, where you're going to just eat the loss
148. just stuff like that
149. And just accepting you're wrong is so critical too
150. Yeah, for sure
151. I respect people who can accept their wrong so much just because I feel like the average dude in finance is like, always like the big dick, like, I don't know, like Ferrari, like, it's always like, you know, very high tea
152. Not saying that it's low tea, but I think it's more mentally ascended if you can like accept where you're wrong, right
153. So it's just like, yeah
154. As for levels breaking and reactions, I do have some of these
155. Let's say if I assume the market is super shorted, but if we take a high and it's a very weak
156. like very few amounts of shorts coming out
157. Um, I might have to doubt my assumptions, stuff like that
158. But generally I also don't do any news at all just because, you know, I'm clicking on the like literal retail interface on like Binance or some, some shit
159. I'm not going to like, I'll compete these, uh, all goes or whatever, like popping off in like 200 millisecond, whatever, whatever
160. I don't, I don't ever, so I don't do any like information stuff
161. Yeah, there's been a few times where I'm just like literally trading and then CPI comes in
162. and I'm like, what the
163. I didn't know, which is like absolutely like retarded of me, I guess, but that happened a few times, definitely
164. Yeah, and otherwise, yeah, I just do my thing, I guess, just like low information
165. more just more chart and more uh like like i don't know momentum trend like
166. just right um
167. and definitely i don't i don't take notes either i guess you can do whatever you want like everyone's a bit different
168. um i don't think there's like one way to like win
169. it's kind of like probably any other like money making thing like there's there's definitely like a lot of ways people everyone's different
170. Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious it's changed a while ago
171. But I think initially I was much more excited about signaling via key purchases and sales
172. Although I never traded anything like how
173. I guess I fantasized about a lot of things, I think
174. I think I wished it was something like, okay, we tell each other who we like and don't like via buying and selling keys, right
175. And how that could signal to people who aren't as in the, I don't know, this entire CT cabal, like who's a better actor, who's not as good of an actor
176. Although the main problem with Frentech was it actually had no true negative signaling
177. And negative signaling had to be done in an anonymous way, in my opinion, just because otherwise it's just extremely, like, aggressive, right
178. And I don't think people are, like, open enough to do that
179. I think generally, that kind of stuff, people tend to be a bit shy, even if, like, I don't know, you're like an MMA fighter, you're not gonna go online and be like, I hate this guy, literally, like, click this button, like, right
180. So I think that was one issue I didn't realize very early on, which was like lack of negative signaling and how there was only positive signaling
181. And then that kind of turned into more of a ponzi real quick
182. And then I guess after like two, three months, I realized like, okay, this is actually not as cool as I thought, or like, I was just like
183. Like, I was fantasized, I was like, like having this fantasy of the, the saying being something else, which is like, totally not
184. I think I, I didn't like mention about like price or like, like the airdrop going into like the token event, then didn't tell anyone to buy it
185. I just like averaged out real quick and like one day, people are like, you're retarded
186. And I'm like, okay, whatever
187. Um, I mean, like, just claiming the airdrop was like, every the entire community was like having AIDS from like, trying to even like, get it to work
188. So I think that's pretty bad
189. Because like, UI is like very critically important, because like, I think not maybe not enough people or brands or just like, projects think about this, but like, your experience with something is like, very critical, right
190. So if you have a negative experience or that's a negative emotion about this thing, then you are literally more likely to not want the thing, which is like the token, whatever it has to do with it, right
191. But if you have positive emotions about something, you're more likely to buy the thing
192. It's like how marketing 101 is, right
193. So it's like the fact that the app lacked so hard
194. was definitely a problem, I think, in my opinion
195. And then although they try to fix it, it was always kind of a thing, right
196. Especially when we all try to use it
197. And I think otherwise it's a completely okay platform
198. I don't think he ever meant it for it to be reputational
199. And I think I just fantasized about it being that because
200. us buying and selling keys were a public display of liking, right
201. But I think Razer really wanted it to be kind of like a fan community thing
202. Like, oh, you think Hasaka's the GOAT, you think I'm the GOAT, you think COAT
203. Not me, sorry
204. provided any value, like if you thought Kobe was a goat, you know, you buy like two of the keys and ask them, like, try to ask them nice questions, they will reply
205. So that that's like real value
206. And there's definitely a market for that
207. But like, definitely not like, whatever, billion, 5 billion, 10 billion I was like, mentally jacking off about about race
208. but I guess if you have a thousand fans, that's
209. he is that expensive, kind of, I guess
210. But yeah, it's hard to justify all of this, I guess
211. But I think the model was mostly okay, at least I thought so
212. Especially if you are not in it for profit, right
213. Because once you buy the, I don't know, there was some certain level of price, it takes exponentially more buying for you to even be able to get out breakeven
214. I think that part was good in that it prevented speculation or like way too much of that
215. But it was also obviously very like extractive because people did try to like, you know, fuck around and they found out really hard, right
216. Like, all the fees were just like, yeah
217. No, I still have like
218. I don't know 50 F or like 30 at least
219. Yeah, probably around 50 ish F in the thing
220. Um, I, I, yeah, I, I did try to like play it like, um, I guess like in, in like I bought a bunch of like smaller accounts and I bought a multiple keys if I like, you know, stuff like that for the smaller accounts
221. I actually self snipe seven keys, seven, seven, 70 keys because, um, uh, yeah, because I, I knew like people were going to snipe it and then like
222. Yeah, I didn't sell that because that just looks really bad
223. And so you don't need a couple of ETH, so it's OK to just put it there
224. There's definitely a couple of notable accounts that promise to share that airdrop
225. And yeah, I will not go further on this topic
226. Check the chain
227. I don't know, man
228. Yeah, I think
229. Um, wait, actually before we, uh, talk about this, can we also include like, uh, can we also talk about life
230. Cause I actually want to know you better because I don't know anything about you actually
231. Um, we can go after this
232. Uh, but yeah, for point systems, I guess, um, I mean, they obviously work, right
233. Like it's, it's not like
234. Starbucks and every like, I don't know if like Chase, like any airline are doing points because it doesn't work like it clearly works
235. And it's like
236. Yeah, it just works
237. It's very simple
238. We all like want to get points for whatever reason
239. It's like crazy, but that's how our brain works
240. And I guess, yeah, Tatian was pretty early onto that, like the blur, right
241. I've always thought of him as like one of the greatest, like Ponzi builders in the space
242. And on top of that
243. It tends to come with something slightly new, so it's pretty good
244. I just had to invest because he literally stole OpenSea from OpenSea
245. It was a no-brainer at the time because there wasn't much other deals
246. A bit of both
247. I thought, why not have all the funds there, earn some yield
248. It makes everyone more money, right
249. It's way more 3-3 than every other
250. Parking your funds anywhere else, right
251. So I thought it was decent enough of an idea to go for
252. That's such a hard question, but I don't think I've had like too much like gigatrillionaire dreams or like what I'm going to do with it
253. But, um, yeah, no, no clue
254. Honestly, I'm just going to like do the same thing
255. Cause like, it's, it's, it's pretty nice so far
256. And I, I'm very content with my current, uh
257. Although not extremely, definitely not hyper wealth at all
258. Yeah, pretty happy with that
259. But I mean, like, you have to put it in my hands for me to like, start thinking about it
260. Right, so I guess one thing would be like, well, I've seen my hyper wealth, you know, yeah, continue to live in hotels
261. But actually, I'm not sure
262. But like, I guess I want a private chef
263. So when I wake up, there's like food
264. I want like extremely, extremely, extremely healthy food
265. Because I'm like
266. I'm just very into being healthy
267. I've not had a full glass of sugar beverage for nine years
268. I don't even eat birthday cakes at all
269. Actually, I've made two exceptions this year, or one exception here and there
270. You can count them in one hand, right
271. That's how little sugar I consume
272. And I always have broccoli, either broccoli or berries almost every day
273. That's just my vitamin C fiber, antioxidant intake
274. It's just extremely healthy
275. And I always eat that first, because when you eat that, and then you have your favorite fruits
276. Say I'll have a pasta, it's a little bit of carbs
277. Not too crazy
278. But then because you ate the fiber first, you actually digest that way slower
279. And then your glucose spike is way softer
280. Just stuff like that
281. And I care a lot about my appearance
282. My skin is in amazing conditions
283. Every girl would be jealous
284. And then I guess I also have like a bunch of like, like somewhat philanthropic thoughts
285. I know this word is like giga curse now because of Sam Bankman
286. But like, there's like a bunch of like, yeah
287. there's a bunch of like content creators like I really, really like respect just because like
288. you can clearly tell like oh this guy or this girl like they are completely not selling out like right they are they're like say producing content purely like the amount of passion they have for say a video game or like whatever they're doing is like so great that that they just do that and that they have no view about like
289. like no sense about like be doing business or like, like how this doing this or that can make me more money
290. So like, if I can like support more of these people, like, it makes me really fulfilled, I guess
291. Just because like, I guess I do follow a bunch of these people in day to day, I just think they're very cool
292. I'm very big into like, expression, virtual expression, or just like expression in real life
293. I dress well
294. But yeah, just like stuff like that
295. I really respect like people who do that online to like
296. Yeah, so yeah
297. it's stuff like that
298. If I can support more people, that's like very awesome
299. But yeah, I think living in hotels is like an amazing door and
300. I like I and as I said, I'm like someone who like live in a fantasy, right
301. So like I I just want to do this forever
302. I want to stay young forever
303. So that which is why I do have all these routines
304. Although I've done like few lines of coke before
305. I don't think that that's like really bad for your aging, right
306. Actually definitely like Take other stuff for like preventing like higher blood pressure if I do stuff like this, like yeah, definitely definitely hedged
307. I do care a lot about this kind of stuff
308. But I also value a lot about having fun with my friends
309. Emotions is another thing I'm a big maxi of
310. Sorry, you go
311. Yeah, I literally eat the entire plate of broccoli
312. It's like a massive plate
313. I will literally finish it before starting the steak
314. It's pretty easy to me, because I guess I made it a habit
315. I'm a trader
316. I have the discipline to do that
317. This might be disrespectful, but I do not respect any other trader
318. I do not respect any whatever influencer
319. I'm going to just like absorb the information and like a lot of readings
320. I love doing readings and then just like, or trading
321. Like I always have my own view, my own system
322. Whenever I listen to others, like it worsens my, it actually makes it worse for me
323. So just like, like I know, like if you eat fiber before a real meal, you will have like
324. a slower glucose spike
325. This is like proven countless times, right
326. Like just stuff like that is like, basically are facts proven nonstop
327. Like I will do them
328. So I don't have a lot of influence
329. The scientific term of like these, like
330. the impact of a meal is called like postprandial spiking of the first time I read it
331. I had to like Google like 18 words out of 30 words in the first paragraph, but you know, it's honestly not that crazy
332. Like you open a paper, you've, yeah, first, first minute you have to Google half the shit, but then you understand everything and then you keep going
333. It's like, it's honestly not as scary as people think
334. I absolutely have thoughts on, like my biggest two beliefs about education is like, one, we need to teach about online fraud because like
335. The economy is literally going so virtual
336. We have Amazon now
337. We didn't have it 15 years ago
338. We have eBay
339. All these things are popping off
340. So much like skin trading and obviously crypto
341. And then people are getting all these emails that are like, oh, you're a student
342. And then, I don't know, some school should get hacked so easily
343. And then you get fraudulent mail about your school deposit
344. They need to learn that
345. Yeah, you already got rugged on FTX and then a fake claims email come out, you get rugged again
346. And it's just not crypto, exactly
347. It's like so much, it's like everywhere, right
348. And then another big belief I have is everyone needs to learn about research methods
349. So this course in college teaches you how to research information for yourself, right
350. But it's just like this general idea of trying to obtain correct
351. like information for yourself is just so important
352. And I feel like many people don't really get to learn that or like
353. yeah, they just don't, right
354. So it's like these two topics are like very critical in modern day that I think, like no school teaches about it
355. It's just like, or it's not like a critical course, right
356. But like it has to be like a foundational course in my opinion, yeah
357. Yeah, I've not seen an octagon in real life in eight years
358. More than everything, yeah
359. Way more than everything
360. like when I finished school, like I didn't apply to a job, like I'm not sure why
361. And then all my friends are like, yeah
362. I'm going to this, um, Oh, I got an internship to begin with, uh, but it's Intel and or like some shit
363. And I'm like, Oh, cool
364. I, I, I had nothing to say
365. And then just traded this Ponzi and like had to learn, never took a single finance course
366. Like, yeah, definitely
367. I had to, yeah
368. And then one day you're trading the, you know, the most popular product, the BTC USDT, and then tethered DPEX three pigs, three bips, and then you're, yeah
369. and then you're scared
370. Yeah, there's a lot of shit going on
371. I did actually panic
372. So it was pretty bad
373. But I actually bought I just bought spot instead
374. So I was up a few percent and versus it was kind of like, okay, I guess
375. Like, I don't know anything about signature banks
376. I'm just like, yeah
377. I'm gonna go and eat going fucking theory and bro like fuck the shit
378. I learned something new today
379. If my bank's insolvent, I lose 3% confirmed by the real estate GCR
380. Oh, also as a, as, as real estate GCR, I was going to ask about like houses, right
381. Like for like, like mid tier homes, right
382. Like, cause I'm not like elite, like hyperbole, whatever
383. Like if I buy like, uh, is it, am I buying the top right now
384. But like the shit only goes up, right
385. Like I'm staying in hotels as like a funding way to like short housing and it's not working out for me at all
386. But like, I don't know, like, maybe it's just like a trader mindset
387. Like, I just don't want to buy the top
388. Yeah, that's fair
389. I should just look at it like fashion then
390. Like, oh, I bought this nice piece of jacket
391. Oh, wait, the secondary market went down like $200
392. Our advice has been obtained
393. from real estate GCR
394. Yeah, real estate GCR
395. So this is, I think one of my most, uh, my biggest weakness is like this kind of views because like, I've always traded on like day to day week to week and most short term stuff
396. Maybe at most like one or two months
397. Like I don't think I've ever had a trade where I'm like, yeah, like Q4 is going to pop like, and we're in Q2 right now
398. Like that just never happened
399. Overall, I do tend to think that people are over-exaggerating the top signals
400. Because if you go relatively cycle by cycle, DeFi summer was absolutely crazy, even for people who went through 2017
401. And they were like, yo, this is crazy
402. And then when the first DeFi pullback, everyone was shorting
403. Like, so, so relatively, like, I think we're kind of similar in that, like, yeah, celebs are popping in and that's like, to me, just about like as crazy as like 2021, if not, like even a bit less, just cause like, we don't have that STEMI checks
404. We don't have like, um, that kind of stuff
405. And I think my views are really weak, by the way, just because I'm an absolute retard when it comes to this kind of macro view, because I know nothing about macro
406. I didn't even know Trump was favored until GCR said it, and I'm like
407. I have to trust politics GCR, or literally him side
408. He is literally the go of politics, right
409. So I'm like, he's like, yeah
410. I'm like, okay
411. Trump won, guys, yeah
412. I don't know anything about
413. And he's going to somehow pump the markets
414. I heard like, apparently it's super bullish and he's like confirmed at this point, basically they could even assassinate him
415. He, my bro, my bro literally turned his head and it's like, just nailed it
416. Like, like it's so crazy
417. Like, so I, yeah
418. I don't have too much
419. We, I think I heard like a third of the Gox coins are bought out and then like some, something like that
420. And then it's like, yeah
421. but I don't know if they're going to sell, right
422. They're definitely in for a profit too
423. So like, yeah
424. Yeah, like last few weeks were definitely a bit more like shorter and like less allocated
425. And then this week inflows were really strong so far
426. So that's been really promising, at least like, like for the first time we have like a 30% like pullback where like, you know, TradFight bros are like
427. yeah, we're bidding like 200 mil inflow, 300 mil inflow
428. So that's like
429. impressive, I guess
430. Yeah, because like, at some point, I think people were talking about like, oh, if we have a 30% pullback, the ETFs are gonna start panic selling or something
431. And we didn't really see too much of that, right
432. So that's pretty strong to me
433. Yeah, but I'm always like, like on crypto, I'm always like, softly perma bullish, I guess
434. I definitely am like, definitely do call cycle tops, like last cycle, I kind of did and like
435. definitely do get bearish
436. But yeah, I think we're still like somewhat pre definitely
437. Half of them blocked me, I noticed
438. Maybe, I don't know, lifestyle GCR
439. Yeah, because I don't know
440. I think I just live my own fantasy, my own world
441. I absolutely do not care about anyone's opinion on what I'm doing
442. I'm literally in my bubble, very moisturized and like in a hotel right now, as we speak
443. Actually, first time at, I'm at the **** right now, first time staying
444. Probably a decent review, end of the stay
445. Yeah, I still haven't explored even all the hotels, because I'm pretty like autistic in the way
446. I need to do the same thing
447. So if I go to a new hotel, like, wait, where do I go to get coffee and breakfast again
448. Do I have to go here now
449. It's kind of like a, I don't know, habit break
450. So I was staying at some other hotel for a month
451. Whenever I go, I was there
452. I've not stayed at too much chain hotels, honestly
453. I've always preferred medium, smaller brands
454. Okay, I guess I was impressed by like pendry service when I was like checking in It's like I had three massive jacked dudes like protecting me opening the door and carrying my like luggage up I was like, wow, you know even four seasons didn't do this
455. This is crazy
456. Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of pendry
457. but they don't they only have like I don't know like five branch or something
458. Yeah, I'm like honestly, uh, yeah not nothing
459. Yeah, nothing too notable
460. Like Marriott stole my unisocks because I just have it like a package there
461. Physical one, it was worth 80 grand when it was like thrown away by them
462. Yeah, I just literally had it on my desk
463. It literally just looked like a cardboard box that's empty because it weighs so little
464. They literally thought it was trash and threw it out
465. I'm like, dude, we need to go to the trash truck right now to get it back
466. It's a highly valuable personal item
467. And they're like, oh, it's gone, bro
468. I don't know what you're talking about
469. They don't remember what they threw away
470. I'm like, all right, I'm never coming back
471. I've only been to one in New York and I didn't even stay there
472. I just went there for
473. I went to the bar and then I went to the restaurant in it
474. And then, cause my friend was staying there and he showed me around
475. and I was like, yeah
476. that's very impressive
477. I'm not paying like five grand a day
478. Like I'm not like hyper wealth
479. Especially for me, like I'm not hyper wealth
480. and I do this every day
481. Like I, I literally cannot do a five, 10 grand like that kind of stuff every day for years
482. So it's, it's just like, yeah
483. Sounds like my dream
484. Except I just give them my laundry and they overcharge me by like $200
485. Wait, how much was it in COVID
486. Like what, $250 a night
487. I can't imagine
488. Even during COVID, it was $500
489. I'm just doing like around between maybe like 300 to 1k
490. It varies a lot
491. Yeah, for sure
492. Yeah, I'll bring it up in the next part
493. Oh, that means part two
494. Thank you guys
