==Design==
===Overview===
{{primary sources section|date=May 2024}}
Ethereum is a [[peer-to-peer network]] that maintains a [[database]] containing the storage values of all Ethereum accounts and processes state-altering transactions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Networking Layer |url=https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/ |website=Ethereum.org |access-date=25 May 2024 }}</ref> Approximately every 12 seconds, a batch of new transactions, known as a "block", is processed by the network.
Keywords: ethereum, 2024, upgrade

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: Each block contains a [[Cryptographic_hash_function|cryptographic hash]] identifying the series of blocks that must precede it if the block is to be considered valid.
Keywords: block, contains, cryptographic_hash_function

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: This series of blocks is known as the [[blockchain]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Blocks |url=https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/ |website=Ethereum.org |access-date=25 May 2024 }}</ref>

Each "node" (network participant) connects with a relatively small subset of the network to offer blocks and unvalidated transactions (i.e.
Keywords: blocks, ref, ethereum

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: transactions not yet in the blockchain) to its peers for download, and it downloads any of these from its peers that it doesn't already have.
Keywords: peers, transactions, yet

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: Each node usually has a unique set of peers, so that offering an item to its peers results in the propagation of that item throughout the entire network within seconds.
Keywords: peers, item, node

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: A node's collection of unvalidated transactions is known as its "mempool".<ref>{{cite web |title=Nodes and Clients |url=https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/ |website=Ethereum.org |access-date=25 May 2024 }}</ref>

A node may choose to create a copy of the state for itself.
Keywords: node, ref, nodes

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: It does this by starting with the genesis state and executing every transaction in the blockchain, in the proper order of blocks and in the order they are listed within each block.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) |url=https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/ |website=Ethereum.org |access-date=25 May 2024 }}</ref>

Any Ethereum account may "stake" (deposit) 32 ETH to become a validator.
Keywords: ethereum, order, ref

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: At the end of each "epoch" (32 block slots, each slot lasting 12 seconds), each validator is [[pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] assigned to one of the slots of the epoch after the next, either as the block proposer or as an attester.
Keywords: epoch, block, slots

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: During a slot, the block proposer uses their mempool to create a block that is intended to become the new "head" (latest block) of the blockchain, and the attesters attest to which block is at the head of the chain.
Keywords: block, head, slot

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: If a validator makes self-contradicting proposals or attestations, or if it is inactive, it loses a portion of its stake.
Keywords: validator, makes, self

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: It may add to its stake at any time.
Keywords: may, add, stake

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: A validator's attestation is given a weight equal to its stake or 32, whichever is less.
Keywords: validator, attestation, given

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: According to the Ethereum protocol, the blockchain with the highest accumulated weight of attestations at any given time is to be regarded as the canonical chain.
Keywords: according, ethereum, protocol

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: Validators are rewarded for making valid proposals and attestations.
Keywords: validators, rewarded, making

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: A validator's rewards are paid via transactions within the same chain that contains their proposal or attestation, and therefore would have little or no market value unless that chain becomes the canonical chain.
Keywords: chain, validator, rewards

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: This incentivizes validators to support the chain that they think other validators view as the canonical chain, which results in a high degree of consensus.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Staking?

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: The base fee is "burned" (deleted from existence) and the tip goes to the block proposer.
Keywords: base, fee, burned

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: The validator reward together with the tips provide the incentive to validators to keep the blockchain growing (i.e.
Keywords: validator, reward, together

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: to keep processing new transactions).
Keywords: keep, processing, new

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: Therefore, ETH is fundamental to the operation of the network.
Keywords: therefore, eth, fundamental

The uppercase Greek letter [[Xi (letter)|Xi]], Ξ, is sometimes used as a [[currency symbol]] for ether.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

===Accounts===
There are two types of accounts on Ethereum: user accounts (also known as externally-owned accounts), and contract accounts.
Keywords: date, ethereum, ether

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: Both types have an ETH balance, may transfer ETH to any account, may execute the code of another contract, or create a new contract, and are identified on the blockchain and in the state by an account address.<ref name="bloomberg20201125">{{cite news |date=25 November 2020 |title=Ethereum Upgrade Adds to Crypto Mania Sparked by Bitcoin's Surge |work=Bloomberg.com |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-25/ethereum-upgrade-adds-to-crypto-mania-sparked-by-bitcoin-s-surge |url-status=live |access-date=28 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128213844/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-25/ethereum-upgrade-adds-to-crypto-mania-sparked-by-bitcoin-s-surge |archive-date=28 November 2020}}</ref>

Contracts are the only type of account that has associated [[bytecode]] and storage (to store contract-specific state).

Keywords: operations, current, instruction

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: The EVM is designed to be [[Deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] on a wide variety of [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[operating system]]s, so that given a pre-transaction state and a transaction, each node produces the same post-transaction state, thereby enabling network consensus.
Keywords: transaction, deterministic, hardware

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper.<ref name=eip150/><ref name="DEBA20">{{cite report |title=Developing an Ethereum Blockchain Application |last=Triantafyllidis |first=Nikolaos Petros |date=19 February 2016 |publisher=University of Amsterdam |page=20 |chapter=The Ethereum Project: Ethereum History}}</ref> EVMs have been implemented in [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], [[Elixir (programming language)|Elixir]], [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]], and soon{{when|reason=This article has been claiming at least since 2018 that EVMs implemented in WebAssembly will come "soon".|date=October 2021}} [[WebAssembly]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

===Gas===
Gas is a [[unit of account]] within the EVM used in the calculation of the transaction fee, which is the amount of ETH a transaction's sender must pay to the network to have the transaction included in the blockchain.
Keywords: programming, language, ethereum

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: Each type of operation which may be performed by the EVM is [[hardcoded]] with a certain gas cost, which is intended to be roughly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the monetary value of the resources (e.g.
Keywords: type, operation, may

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: [[computation]] and [[Computer data storage|storage]]) a node must expend or dedicate to perform that operation.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

When a sender is creating a transaction, the sender must specify a ''gas limit'' and ''gas price''.
Keywords: storage, must, sender

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: The ''gas limit'' is the maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to use in the transaction, and the ''gas price'' is the amount of ETH the sender wishes to pay to the network per unit of gas used.
Keywords: gas, amount, sender

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: A transaction may only be included in the blockchain at a block slot that has a ''base gas price'' less than or equal to the transaction's ''gas price''.
Keywords: transaction, gas, price

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: The portion of the ''gas price'' that is in excess of the ''base gas price'' is known as the tip and goes to the block proposer; the higher the tip, the more incentive a block proposer has to include the transaction in their block, and thus the quicker the transaction will be included in the blockchain.
Keywords: block, gas, price

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: The sender buys the full amount of gas (i.e.
Keywords: sender, buys, full

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: their ETH balance is debited ''gas limit'' × ''gas price'' and their gas balance is set to ''gas limit'') up-front, at the start of the execution of the transaction, and is refunded at the end for any unused gas.
Keywords: gas, balance, limit

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: If at any point the transaction does not have enough gas to perform the next operation, the transaction is reverted but the sender is still only refunded for the unused gas.
Keywords: transaction, gas, point

Name: Ethereum
Sentence: In [[user interface]]s, gas prices are typically denominated in gigawei (Gwei), a subunit of ETH equal to 10<sup>−9</sup> ETH.<ref>{{cite journal |last=de Azevedo Sousa |first=José Eduardo |year=2020 |title=An analysis of the fees and pending time correlation in Ethereum |url=http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/lanoms/lanoms2019/196411_1.pdf |journal=International Journal of Network Management |issue=e2113 |access-date=14 October 2020 |archive-date=9 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709090818/http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/lanoms/lanoms2019/196411_1.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
