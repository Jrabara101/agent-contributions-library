So, yeah, if I gave you eight million Hong Kong dollars, how would you spend it
I would probably use it buying NFTs
I think of them as stores of digital culture, things that are used to describe fashion, art
Some of them are worth millions of dollars in themselves
I think it speaks to who I am, it speaks to the kind of culture that I want to promote and it speaks to my identity
My name is Yatsu
I'm chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, a company that's at the forefront of creating true digital property rights to the world
I think the guiding philosophy for myself and I think by extension the businesses that I've helped create is around delivering things that have impact on purpose
Life actually is a game in itself already and it's just not very well designed for most of us
But in the metaverse, you can actually create new type of experiences that actually mimic life in itself with maybe better rules or more fair rules for all
So, I mean, my journey really started, I would say, in the 80s
I ended up getting introduced to, I guess, the digital world, actually the Atari back in the early days
I made friends online
I created a business online
It was interesting to extend to the world from a screen
And that was actually perhaps the one thing that ultimately really appealed to people like myself and others that helped sort of create this movement
building and investing in 20, 30 years ago, you would have probably been in a kind of early adopter era of a market, and you would simply grow just because the market is growing
But often you find yourself in the innovation stage where we are right now, because in technology, we are not necessarily actually riding the wave
We're sometimes creating that wave
The only way to do that is to invest in founders who have a similar vision and who are trying to help spearhead and shape that space
If you find the right people, then I think it would be definitely worthwhile, the long investment that you make, irrespective of whether it takes five, 10, 20 years or a lifetime
I guess wealth to me really means being well
It's also being well in the mind and I guess spiritually in a sense, right
I feel that the work we're doing is a net good for the world
And that to me is a kind of wealth
