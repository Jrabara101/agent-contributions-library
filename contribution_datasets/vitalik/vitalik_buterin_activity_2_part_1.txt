"This would reduce the maximum block size from 2.7 megabytes to approximately 1MB and make room for potentially increasing the block gas limit or the number of blobs. 

Buterin expressed concern that some L2s are hesitant to move to blobs due to potential market congestion. He warned, “We cannot afford to let momentum slip on moving more layer 2s over to using blobs,” adding:

“EIP-7623 is crucial for this because it ensures that the worst-case size of a block massively decreases.” 

Buterin views layer-2 networks as essential components for Ethereum scaling but he also emphasized that they must be decentralized"	Ethereum, Crypto, General
"Recently he stated that he only plans to acknowledge scaling solutions at “stage 1” of his decentralization scale.

In a Sept. 26 X post, Coinbase L2 Base creator Jesse Pollak said he strongly supports Buterin’s proposal to increase blob count"	Ethereum, General
"Pollak said it “reduces worst-case block size and adds needed capacity for fast-growing L2s,” and “the growth is exponential.” 

The highly anticipated Prague upgrade will focus on changes to the network’s execution layer, with the Electra upgrade impacting the consensus layer, hence the name Pectra (Prague Electra). It includes a number of EIPs that will improve scalability, introduce account abstraction and increase validator staking limits. 

Ethereum developers proposed splitting the Pectra upgrade into two segments, PectraA and PectraB, to accelerate its deployment.
