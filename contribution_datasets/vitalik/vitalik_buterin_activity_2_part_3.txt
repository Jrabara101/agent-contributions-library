In his latest blog post on Sept.  28, Buterin said achieving “Ethereum alignment” is one of the most important social challenges in the Ethereum ecosystem"	Ethereum

Still, he acknowledged that it’s a tough task, given the vast array of client teams, application developers, researchers and local communities — each trying to contribute to Ethereum in a unique way. 

“The primary challenge is making sure that all these projects are, collectively, building something that feels like one Ethereum ecosystem, and not 138 incompatible fiefdoms"	Ethereum

Buterin said there are already several “starting points,” such as how open source a project is. 

He said that while “open source” means code can be inspected for security purposes, it also reduces the risk of proprietary lock-in and allows third parties to make improvements"	General

There’s also how interoperable a project is, with Buterin suggesting that applications and wallets could be rated by which ERCs they are compatible with. 

Meanwhile, decentralization and security could also be measured by the “walkaway” and “insider attack” tests"	Crypto, General

“If your team and servers disappear tomorrow, will your application still be usable?” 

“If your team itself tries to attack the system, how much will break, and how much harm could you do,” he said.  

A project could also be judged on how positive it is for the Ethereum community or for humanity — for example, improving financial inclusion and enabling new public funding mechanisms, he said"	Ethereum

Buterin stressed how important it is for Ethereum to remain credibly neutral. 

“If alignment means having the right friends, then ‘alignment’ as a concept has failed"	Ethereum

In July, Ethereum community member Ryan Berckmans stressed to Cointelegraph how important it is for Ethereum builders to limit marketing — as it could create an environment where winners and losers emerge. 

“While it's literally good for growth, it ends up turning your chain and community into a politically charged partnership swamp, and that will prevent the serious growth down the line where corporations and governments start relying on onchain for very important and large activities"	Ethereum, General

Buterin is a highly influential voice in the Ethereum ecosystem.  In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, said that Ethereum may be relying too heavily on Buterin for direction"	Ethereum
