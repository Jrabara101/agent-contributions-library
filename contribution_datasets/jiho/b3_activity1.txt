Read more News 1 year ago Jihoz Sparks Twitter War with Corey Wilton: Calls Pegaxy a ‚ÄòFailed Horse Racing Game‚Äô Jihoz , a Co-Founder of Axie Infinity , sparked a Twitter war with Corey Wilton , the CEO of Pegaxy after he threw shade against the latter	axie, jihoz, game
So, what‚Äôs the ‚Äútea‚Äù all about? Let‚Äôs see! This account is run by the team behind a failed horse racing game. Don‚Äôt engage with it as the owners have a record of manipulation and failure	game
Thanks for voting for Ronin network ü§ù https://t.co/5ZmSABapvq ‚Äî The Jiho.eth (@Jihoz_Axie) May 10, 2023 P2E News recently shared a Twitter poll asking followers to vote for the best Web3 gaming ecosystem. It appears that the poll was shared without any ulterior motive on any specific entity	jiho, web3, gaming
However, Jihoz subsequently retweeted the post, advising his followers not to engage with P2E News since according to him, its owners have a record of manipulation and failure. It seems that Jihoz believed that P2E News was still under the management of Corey	jihoz
Jihoz‚Äôs retweet included the caption: This account is run by the team behind a failed horse racing game . Don‚Äôt engage with it as the owners have a record of manipulation and failure	jihoz, game
Corey quickly responded to Jihoz‚Äôs tweet, questioning why he never say ‚Äúthings‚Äù to him in person such as at Philippine Web3 Festival where the two were present. You tripping ser! Why you never say things to me when we are in person at the same events? Very silent about your opinions until you‚Äôre online	jihoz, web3
Haven‚Äôt owned this page in a year, and unfortunately we haven‚Äôt failed at @PegaxyOfficial as much as you‚Äôd like to think so, but keep‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Corey Wilton üá¶üá∫ (@RealCoreyWilton) May 11, 2023 Corey emphasized that he hasn‚Äôt owned P2E News in a year . He also defended Pegaxy, stating that they have not failed as much as Jihoz claimed 	jihoz
Corey challenged Jihoz to specify the manipulation he was referring to and questioned the progress of Jihoz‚Äôs goal to reach 1 million followers. But why did Jihoz suddenly attack Corey and Pegaxy? First, it‚Äôs important to know why everybody is shocked about Jihoz‚Äôs behavior against Corey	jihoz
According to Corey, Jihoz was in the line behind him at dinner (during the Philippine Web3 Fest) and even went to their after-party (Gathering of the Greats at Xylo bar in BGC). Jihoz was also seen replying to Corey‚Äôs tweet in 2022, which gave the community the impression that the two were positively interacting and building in the Web3 space 	jihoz, web3

No drama. No hype	
No punching down. It's always the blind followers‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DrhrLCkVEd ‚Äî focc_x NO | RDG (@focc_x) March 18, 2022 So, why is Jihoz suddenly throwing shades against Corey? No one knows the exact answer	jihoz
However, let‚Äôs analyze the possibilities of what could have triggered Jihoz to post such a tweet. First , Jihoz may have been offended by the meme posted by Corey on Twitter, which replaced Jihoz‚Äôs face with Corey‚Äôs in a popular picture, saying ‚Äú2022, WE‚ÄôLL SHOCK THE WORLD (AGAIN)	jihoz
It was captioned ‚ÄúWho made this?!‚Äù. Who made this?! üò§ pic.twitter.com/cAMlncDfFJ ‚Äî Corey Wilton üá¶üá∫ (@RealCoreyWilton) April 24, 2023 The picture was originally Jihoz‚Äôs face, with the quote from his tweet from January 1, 2022	jihoz
How do you think they‚Äôll shock the world this year? üëá Source: https://t.co/eHiFvY2vlM pic.twitter.com/eBD45yAXqn ‚Äî P2E News (@P2ENewsOfficial) January 7, 2022 Jihoz‚Äôs tweet stating that they will shock the world again in 2022. Second , P2E News‚Äô tweet about Axie Infinity: The price of Axie Infinity land has taken a tumble, but is it still a good investment opportunity? #AxieHomeland #AxieInfinity pic.twitter.com/HD4OOPTmkL ‚Äî P2E News (@P2ENewsOfficial) May 10, 2023 As earlier mentioned, Jihoz was under the impression that P2E News was still owned by Corey, which has since been proven to be untrue	axie, jihoz
It‚Äôs possible that Jihoz interpreted the above tweet as a harsh critique against Axie Infinity, when in fact it was simply a post aiming to get community opinions. Hours later after Jihoz‚Äôs controversial statement, Corey posted a tweet saying that he just want to build Mirai Labs with his team in peace	axie, jihoz
Mirai Labs is the studio behind Pegaxy and other developing games. Just want to build @TheMiraiLabs with our team in peace üè° I do love my #1 fan though @Jihoz_Axie üíû pic.twitter.com/0uvHV7bJui ‚Äî Corey Wilton üá¶üá∫ (@RealCoreyWilton) May 11, 2023 Meanwhile, the web3 gaming community shared their thoughts about the feud between Jihoz and Corey	jihoz, web3, gaming
Many were surprised by Jihoz‚Äôs sudden outburst against Corey and Pegaxy, as he had never shown such behavior before.
